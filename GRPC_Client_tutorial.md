We recently opensourced a python based GRPC client designed to interact with IOS-XR 6.x:

https://github.com/cisco-grpc-connection-libs/ios-xr-grpc-python

The client now includes CLI options and a number of additional sample json snips to include with your RPCs.  This tutorial walks through the use of the GRPC Client CLI and examples.

What you'll need:

1. Management station/laptop: python, python-dev (ubuntu), and 'pip install grpcio'
